## Quick Start

This blog is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). It makes use of scripts found in `/_scripts` to automate certain tasks like adding a new post or generating a new sitemap.

## Setup

To set up the site locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rebreda/rebreda.github.io.git
   cd rebreda.github.io
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Ruby and Bundler installed, then run:

   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

3. **Run the development server**:
   Start the Jekyll server:

   ```bash
   bundle exec jekyll serve
   ```

   The site will be available at `http://localhost:4000`.

4. **Build the site for production**:
   To generate the static files for deployment:

   ```bash
   bundle exec jekyll build
   ```

5. **Customize**:
   Modify the content, styles, or scripts as needed to make the site your own.
